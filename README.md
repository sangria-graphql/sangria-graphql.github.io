## Local Development

If you would like to work on it locally, then you would need to [setup Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/). After Jekyll is installed, you can start local server with:

```bash
jekyll serve --watch
```

And then point browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). This will also automatically pickup all changes you make.
